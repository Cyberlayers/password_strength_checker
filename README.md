# Password Strength Checker with Time to Crack Estimation

## 🚀 Overview
This Python tool analyzes password strength and estimates the **time to crack** the password using entropy calculations and brute-force speed assumptions.

## 📦 Features:
- Checks password complexity using **entropy-based scoring**.
- Estimates time to crack based on a brute-force rate of **1 billion guesses per second**.
- Provides feedback on password security levels.

## 🛠️ How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Run the script: `python password_checker.py`.
4. Enter a password when prompted and receive a **security score** and **time to crack** estimate.

## 📦 Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `colorama` for colored terminal output.
